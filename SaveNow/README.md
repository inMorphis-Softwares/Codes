Save Code directly with CTRL+S/metakey+s functionality

ServiceNow is a very good Cloud plateform but sometimes a good thing could miss some points. All developers who had worked with developer 
tools like "Eclispse", "Visual Studio" or any other tool, they might have been missing one imp. stuff for saving codes i.e, CTRL+S.

Download and install the UpdateSet "SaveNow" from UpdateSet folder.

Alternatively, you can also create a new UI Script and copy paste the script from UI Script folder.

How to USE:

After creating/updating any script, just press "CTRL+S" or "metakey+s" to save/update the file.
